## 1. Introduction to GST {#introduction}

### What is GST?

**Goods and Services Tax (GST)** is a unified indirect tax levied on the supply of goods and services in India. Launched on July 1, 2017, it replaced multiple taxes like:
- VAT (Value Added Tax)
- Service Tax
- Excise Duty
- Entry Tax

### Why GST Matters for Garage Owners

As a garage owner, you:
1. **Charge GST** on services (repairs, maintenance) and parts sold
2. **Collect GST** from customers on behalf of the government
3. **Pay GST** on your purchases (parts, equipment)
4. **File returns** monthly or quarterly declaring sales, purchases, and tax paid
5. **Claim Input Tax Credit (ITC)** on eligible business expenses

**Bottom Line:** GST affects your pricing, cash flow, and compliance obligations.

## 2. GST Basics for Garage Businesses {#basics}

### Types of GST

India has three types of GST based on transaction location:

| Type | Full Form | When Applied | Tax Split |
|------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| **CGST** | Central GST | Intra-state (within same state) | 9% to Central Govt |
| **SGST** | State GST | Intra-state (within same state) | 9% to State Govt |
| **IGST** | Integrated GST | Inter-state (across states) | 18% to Central Govt |

**Example:**
- Your garage is in Karnataka, customer is in Karnataka → Charge **9% CGST + 9% SGST**
- Your garage is in Karnataka, customer is in Tamil Nadu → Charge **18% IGST**

### GST Registration Threshold

**Mandatory registration** if your annual turnover exceeds:
- **₹40 lakh** for businesses in most states
- **₹20 lakh** for businesses in special category states (NE states, J&K, HP, UK)
- **₹20 lakh** for service providers

**Voluntary registration:** You can register even below the threshold to:
- Claim input tax credit
- Appear more professional
- Deal with registered businesses (B2B)

## 9. Input Tax Credit (ITC) {#itc}

### What is ITC?

**Input Tax Credit** allows you to reduce the GST you paid on purchases from the GST you collected on sales.

**Simple Formula:**
```
Net GST Payable = GST on Sales - ITC on Purchases
```

### Example Calculation

**Your Garage (January 2026):**

| Transaction | Amount | GST @18% |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| **Sales (Output)** | | |
| Services provided | ₹1,00,000 | ₹18,000 |
| Parts sold | ₹50,000 | ₹9,000 |
| **Total Output GST** | ₹1,50,000 | **₹27,000** |
| | | |
| **Purchases (Input)** | | |
| Parts purchased | ₹30,000 | ₹5,400 |
| Equipment rental | ₹10,000 | ₹1,800 |
| Office supplies | ₹5,000 | ₹900 |
| **Total Input GST** | ₹45,000 | **₹8,100** |

**ITC Calculation:**
```
GST Collected from customers:     ₹27,000
ITC on eligible purchases:       - ₹8,100
─────────────────────────────────────────
Net GST to pay to government:    ₹18,900
```

**Benefit:** Instead of paying ₹27,000, you only pay ₹18,900!

### Conditions for Claiming ITC

You can claim ITC ONLY if:

1. ✅ **You have a tax invoice** from the supplier
2. ✅ **Supplier has uploaded invoice in their GSTR-1**
3. ✅ **Goods/services received**
4. ✅ **Supplier has paid GST** to the government
5. ✅ **You have filed your returns**
6. ✅ **Used for business purposes**

### What ITC Can You Claim?

| Expense | ITC Claimable? | Reason |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Parts & spares for repairs | ✅ Yes | Business use |
| Equipment & machinery | ✅ Yes | Capital goods |
| Office rent | ✅ Yes | Input service |

- Maintain HSN/SAC code list for commonly sold items

### Mistake 2: Not Reconciling GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B

**Problem:** Mismatch between detailed (GSTR-1) and summary (GSTR-3B) returns  
**Impact:** System flags discrepancy, potential audit  
**Solution:**
- Always file GSTR-1 first (due 11th)

- Auto-populate GSTR-3B from GSTR-1 where possible

### Mistake 3: Claiming ITC Without Verification

**Problem:** Claiming ITC on invoices not uploaded by supplier

- Only claim ITC for invoices visible in GSTR-2B
- Follow up with suppliers for missing invoices

### Mistake 4: Late Filing

**Problem:** Missing filing deadlines  
**Impact:** Late fees, interest, inability to claim ITC next month  
**Solution:**
- Set calendar reminders for 5th, 10th, 15th of month
- Start preparing returns by 5th
- File by 11th (GSTR-1) and 20th (GSTR-3B)
- Use GST software for automated reminders

### Mistake 5: Improper Invoice Numbering

**Problem:** Duplicate, skipped, or non-sequential invoice numbers  
**Impact:** Audit trigger, penalty  
**Solution:**

- Format: `INV-2026-0001`, `INV-2026-0002`, etc.
- Never reuse or skip invoice numbers

### Mistake 6: Not Maintaining Records

| **GSTR-3B** | ₹50/day (₹20 for nil return) | 18% per annum on unpaid tax |

**Maximum late fee:** ₹5,000 per return

- Late fee: ₹50 × 10 = ₹500
- Unpaid tax: ₹20,000
- Interest: ₹20,000 × 18% × (10/365) = ₹98.63

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q1: What if I have no sales in a month?

### Q2: Can I revise GSTR-3B after filing?
**A:** No, GSTR-3B cannot be revised. Corrections must be done in next month's return.

### Q3: What if my supplier didn't upload their invoice?
**A:** You cannot claim ITC. Contact supplier immediately. If they file late, you can claim in a future month.

### Q4: Do I need to charge GST to all customers?

### Q5: Can I claim ITC on vehicle purchase?
