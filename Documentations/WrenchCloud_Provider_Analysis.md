## Risk Assessment

### Gupshup Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |

**Overall Risk:** LOW for your use case

### Cashfree Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| No phone support | Email/chat support, good response times |
| India-only | Perfect for your market |
| Less brand recognition | Users don't see gateway brand |

**Overall Risk:** LOW for your use case

## Migration Path (If Needed Later)

### If You Outgrow Gupshup → Twilio

**Effort:** Medium
- Abstract WhatsApp service layer
- Templates need resubmission
- Webhook URLs change
- ~1 week migration

### If You Outgrow Cashfree → Razorpay

**Effort:** Low-Medium
- Payment flow similar
- Webhook signature verification changes
- Settlement process adjusts
